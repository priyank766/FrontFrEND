# Front FrEND: API-Driven AI Agent Project

Built by Gemini

## Project Description

We are building **Front FrEND**, a tool that advises users on improving or creating UI/UX for their existing projects. If the repository has no UI/UX, the system will propose and generate a frontend connected to the backend based on repo files. If a simple UI exists, the system will suggest improvements. All of this will be done by agentic AI (multiple LLM-based agents) orchestrated via CrewAI.

We will use **uv** as the Python package manager.

**Key principles:**

- Fully **API-driven** (use GitHub API, no local cloning in AI phases)
- Use **logging** for debugging
- **Test after each phase**

---

## Phase 1: Git Tree Fetching (API-Based) ✅

This phase fetches the repo's file structure via API and stores it as a JSON object in memory.

- **How it works:**

  1. Use the GitHub Trees API (recursive) to get all files in one call.
  2. Format into `file_tree.json` structure.
  3. Pass JSON to Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2: UI Detection & Analysis ✅

**Agent: UI Detector**

- **Role:** Check if a UI exists in the repo.
- **Prompt for development:** Analyze file-tree JSON for frontend indicators, infer the framework, request extra file contents if needed, and output `{ exists, tech, examples }`.

---

## Phase 3: UI Suggestion or Generation

**Model:** gemini-2.5-pro for CrewAI agents.

**Note:** Remember to test this phase after implementation.

We split this into two interconnected agents and ensure they use LLM capabilities properly — no hardcoded print statements, all reasoning and output via CrewAI/LLM.

### 3.1 Agent: UI Advisor (if exists)✅

- **Prompt for development:** Fetch relevant UI files via API, analyze for UX, layout, and accessibility, and provide at least 5 improvement suggestions in Markdown code block format.

### 3.2 Agent: UI Generator (if none)✅

- **Prompt for development:** Choose a modern “lovely” stack (React + Tailwind recommended), generate full file content for minimal runnable UI in memory, and output as `{ "path": "file content" }` JSON.

---

## Phase 4: Code Generation for Backend ✅

- **CONNECT the frontend changesto backend:** 
---
### 4.1 Agent validater : read all the frontend changes and check if there is any changes done in previous phase can lead to problems like changed name , new variables , or etc which can lead to error because of phase 3 changes use src/tool for reading the files have to check all files 

### 4.2 Backend Agent : all the details of changes given by 4.1 agent has to be generated by backend agent 
this agent can edit appropriate changes to the file only if 4.1 agent meention any changes in code 
if 4.1 mention there is no changes for backend functionality then no changes 


## Phase 5: Design Validation ✅

**Agent: Design Validator**

- **Prompt for development:** Perform static text-based code review for structure, naming, and completeness — no execution.

---

## Phase 6: Frontend Done ✅

This phase signifies the completion of frontend generation and initial setup.

---

## Phase 7: Connect Frontend to Backend

This phase focuses on integrating the generated frontend with the existing or newly generated backend.
